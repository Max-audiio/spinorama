        <p>
          It is a way to understand quickly a speaker properties, how it will
          sound. It is defined in
          <a
            href="https://shop.cta.tech/products/standard-method-of-measurement-for-in-home-loudspeakers"
            >this standard</a
          >
          from the US <a href="https://cta.tech">CTA</a>. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <img
          src="speakers/Genelec%208341A/ASR/asr-vertical/CEA2034.jpg"
          width="600"
          alt="spinorama from a Genelec 8341A"
        >
        <p>The spinorama gives you a few graphs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>On Axis:</b> this the frequency response of the speaker on axis.
            You expect it to be as flat as possible above 100Hz.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Listening Window:</b> this an average of various measurements
            around on axis. The idea is that it is closer to real life since
            your head is always moving a bit in practice and you are not staying
            frozen in front on the speakers. It is expected to be close to the
            previous one, slighlty going down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Early reflections:</b> expected to be a smooth, slowy going down
            line.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sound power:</b> expected to be a smooth, slowy going down line
            (slope is greater than Early Reflections for classical speakers).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>ERDI and SPDI:</b> are the difference between the Early
            Reflection curve and the Listening Window (resp. Sound Power and
            Listening Window). This should be as straight as possible above 100
            Hz. If the DI curves are linear, you will be able to correct the
            frequency aberations of your speaker easily. It is important to
            understand that a bad directivy cannot be corrected with an IIR eq.
            The slope of the line gives a good idea of the speaker properties.
            Note that you will not get a flat line except for speakers designed
            for this (and they are usually large): they are usually labelled as
            constant directivity speakers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The speaker above is <i>very</i> good. You can compare with another
          one:
        </p>

          alt="spinorama for a Tannoy XT6"
        >
        <p>
          which is not flat at all. Remember that &plusmn;3dB means that the
          volume doubles/halves at the corresponding frequency. If you look at
          the on axis measurement below, you see that it going up, the speaker
          will likely be bright and emphasis high frequency.

        <h2 class="title">Can I trust the data?</h2>
        The measurements are collected on the internet. Some are of very high
        quality and done by independant reviewers, some are of medium or low
        quality or provided by vendors.

        <h2 class="title">How precise are the measurement data?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>High quality</i> data: provided by a Klippel NFS or measured in a
            large anechoic chamber. Data precision is around
            1%. Smoothing post measurement can be done by the Klippel
            software so you cannot necessary compare two Klippel
            measurements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Medium quality</i> data: medium size anechoc chamber, data
            precision decreases &lt;500Hz. By how much is unknown.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Low quality</i> data:
            <ul>
              <li>
                measured without an anechoic chamber but using windowing for
                high frequency and plane ground method for low frequency.
                Precision can be as good as a Klippel measurements.
              </li>
              <li>
                provided by vendors: usually smoothed data (less measurement
                points, or data is smoothed, or quality is just
                unknown).

            a higher core higher (+0.7) with respect to a
            score computed from the raw
            data. Note that the 0.7 can change depending on the amount of
            smoothing and other factors. Personally I never compare a score
            computed with high quality data with something else.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title">How precise are the computed data?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Generally precision depends on the quality of the input data. If you
            want to compare 2 measurements, you should select them from the same
            category.
          </li>
          <li>
            Score computations
            <ul>
              <li>
                The score is not significant &pm;0.5. It means that 2 speakers
                which have a difference in score less than 1 are in the same
                broad bucket. No point to look at the decimals.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Anechoic EQ computations
            <ul>
              <li>
                EQ is for one measurement. Since there are variations speaker to
                speaker, you should not look at very sharp or very precise EQ.
                How much variation between speakers? This is very brand/model
                dependant. Some manufactures provide tolerance like Neumann or
                Genelec.
              </li>
              <li>
                IIR eq (aka PEQs) are not working if the phase is varying a lot
                over some frequency range. Group delay (phase derivative) must
                be relatively flat. That may explain why EQing around the
                crossover frequency does not necessary give excellent results.
                On this other side, we are less sensitive to phase anomaly than
                frequency anomaly.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title">
          Can I use this data to decide which speaker to buy
        </h2>
        See dedicated section below.

        <h2 class="title">Should I use room EQ?</h2>
        Absolutly! Dirac, REW, Audyssey etc will provide audible improvement to
        the sound, in general making it flatter (so more tonally correct).
        Almost all AVR have one built-in. All computers and most phones can do
        it with a built-in or free application.

        <h2 class="title">Focus or broad radiation pattern?</h2>
        Speakers do not radiate uniformly. Some speakers are designed to be very
        focus: they minimise the reflections but the sweet spot is very tiny.
        Some speakers are designed to diffuse sound, research proved it is
        something that people usually like. If you are near field, for example
        on a desk, low directivity works well. The farther from the speaker you
        are, the more good directivity becomes important. If the room is
        reflective, this is especially important. If you live in a modern flat
        with hard walls and floor to ceiling windows, looking for speakers with
        a narrow directivity can be a very good way to solve room issues.

        <h1>How to select your speaker?</h1>
        That is a polemic section, I know, I know.

        <h2>Criteria</h2>
        I believe there are a few criteria in whatever order you want:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Price:
            <p>
              Price is not linked to quality (sadly) and is a factor where you
              are the only judge of the worthiness.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Design:
            <p>
              Design is to each is own. Some like monkey coffins, some like
              studio monitors, some like big horns, it is up to you
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Build quality:
            <p>
              Some brands built to high standars some don't. Do some due
              diligence.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Support quality:
            <p>
              Who can or will repair your speaker if you have an issue? How long
              do they store parts? How long is the guarantee? What is covered.
              It is worth a close look if you buy once in a lifetime expensive
              speakers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Tonality:
            <p>
              Here we have more concensus, a lot of people like the same thing.
              To be HIFI, you want to have a speaker with a high tonality score.
              This score takes into account flatness, directivity and how much
              bass you will get.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            SPL aka Sound Power level:
            <p>
              How loud do you want your speaker to be? It depends a lot of your
              room and at which level you want to listen.
            </p>
            Some examples:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bedroom 3m x 4m, listening distance &lt;2m, 73dB reference
                level, +20 dB for peak: 93dB at 1 meter. Around 90dB per
                speaker.
              </li>
              <li>
                Living room 6m x 8m, listening distance &lt;3m, 73dB reference
                level, +20 dB for peak: 93dB at 1 meter. Around 96dB per
                speaker.
              </li>
              <li>
                Large room or studio 7m x 12m, listening distance &lt;5m, 73dB
                reference level, +20 dB for peak: 93dB at 1 meter. Around 116dB
                per speaker.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Bass extension:
            <p>
              Small speakers dont have much bass. You need a subwoofer or a
              large speaker if you want both deep bass and high volume. New
              speakers with DSP can produce a lot of bass while being small but
              not at high volume. If you listen to music only and do not like
              electronic music, you dont need subwoofers with large speakers.
            </p>
            Some examples:
            <ul>

            You can choose floorstanders or bookshelves with subwoofers.
            Integration is not easy but very doable especially if you use an
            AVR. Most people like bass, your neighbourgh may not like
            <i>your</i> bass.

        <h2>How good is your room?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Is the room dedicated to music?</li>
          <li>Is the room symmetrical?</li>
          <li>Does the room have some absorption?</li>
          <li>Did you add panels to control reflections?</li>
          <li>Did you have multiple subwoofers to control bass linearity?</li>
          <li>Did you measured your speakers in your room?</li>
        </ul>

        If you did not answer yes each times, then you do not need the best
        speakers in the world and obsessing over scores, SPL etc will not make
        it the best room in the world. At the same time, I understand very well
        the attraction of having a great pair of speakers. Speakers with a high
        tonality score will be easier to EQ and will adapt well to your room.
        Define the SPL you want (at 1% distorsion) and now you have reasonable
        choices.

	Each speaker measurement shows up in a box similar to:

            alt="Example for one speaker on the landing page"
            >
	</picture>
	<ul>
	  <li id="priceDefinition">
	    <b>Price</b>: should be self explanatory; it is in USD per
	    speaker not for a pair. The price was the first hit on Google
	    when I looked it up. It may be different in your country and/or
	    later in time.
	  </li>
	  <li id="tonalityDefinition">
	    <b>Tonality</b>: this is a value between -10 and 10. It is defined in
	    the <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/cea/cea20342015ansi">CEA2034</a>
	    standard and is computed from the spinorama data.
	    <ul>
	      <li>Higher is better</li>
	      <li>It make sense for tower, bookshelves or center but
		not for surround, in-wall or column speakers; if you
		see *** instead of a number, it is to remind you that
		the score is not valid for some shapes of
		speakers. If you go to the page of a speaker you
		will still still see the computed value. It needs to
		be taken with care. It may "work" for some speakers
		but not for others. The predicted in-room response
		assumes a rectangular room with standard reflection
		and a dipole speaker. All bets are off for a stadium
		or an omnidirectional speaker.</li>
	      <li>Note that a difference between two scores is
		only significant if the difference is greater than
		0.6. </li>
	      <li>Be also mindfull than smoother or less precise data
	      can yield a higher score than an Klippel generated set
		of data for example. You can easily remove 0.5 to 1.5
	      to the score for highly smoothed data.</li>
	      <li>The score does not tell about maximum output or
		about distorsion. You can get the same score for a
		portable bluetooth speaker and a large tower.</li>
	      <li>If you know how to read code, you can find my
		implementation in
		python <a href="https://github.com/pierreaubert/spinorama/blob/master/src/spinorama/compute_cea2034.py">here</a>. There
		is also a version in Cython which is faster if needed
		be in the same repository.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li id="bassExtensionDefinition">
	    <b>Bass extension</b>: this is low frequency extension
	    (LFX in short) from a research paper from Olive. It is computed
	    as <a href="https://github.com/pierreaubert/spinorama/blob/3b6e70966e0466328f44f36752cc182f3ae7baae/src/spinorama/compute_scores.py#L110">here</a>. Lower
	    is better. Note that it is slighlty different from the frequency of
	    the -3dB point. The rational for using it is: <i>The low frequency extension (LFX)
         LFX = log10(xSP-6dB.re:y _ LW(300Hz-10kHz) (7)
    where LFX is the log10 of the first frequency x_SP below 300 Hz
    in the sound power curve, that is -6 dB relative to the mean level y_LW
    measured in listening window (LW) between 300 Hz-10 kHz.
    LFX is log-transformed to produce a linear relationship between the
    variable LFX and preference rating. The sound power curve (SP) is used
    for the calculation because it better defines the true bass output of
    the loudspeaker, particularly speakers that have rear-firing ports.</i>.
	  </li>
	  <li id="flatnessDefinition">
	    <b>Flatness</b>: this is the variation in dB around the average SPL of
